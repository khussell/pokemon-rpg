A RPG game with your favorite Pokemon characters!

What do I do in this game?

This is an RPG where you will pick a character as your fighter from four choices. Once you have chosen, the other three will become your enemies. You will have to plan what character to fight and when depending on your and your opponents HP. Your attack power will increment with every attack but the enemy's counter attack will always stay the same. Once you have caught all three enemies you win!
